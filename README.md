This PureData patch performs pitch analysis at the beginning and end of a sound sample, and matches it to one of many harmonically-organised samples of a different character.  

You must name the samples you want triggered by each note to match the format of the sigmund~ object (i.e. as an integer representing the corresponding fundamental frequency).

Any questions, get in touch.
